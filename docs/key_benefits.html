                <h5>Parallel Development</h5>
                <p>
                    GitFlow streamlines parallel development because it isolates any new developments from work that is
                    completed. Features and non-emergency bug fixes are only merged back into the master branch, i.e.
                    the main body of code, once the person working on it has completed all of their tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is particularly helpful when a developer needs to switch from one task to another and the
                    original task has not been completed. To switch tasks, make sure to commit any changes before
                    creating a new feature branch for the other task. When the other task is completed, checkout the
                    initial feature branch that was being worked on and continue any tasks that remain incomplete.
                </p>
                <h5>Collaboration</h5>
                <p>
                    When two or more developers need to collaborate on the same feature, the use of feature branches
                    makes it significantly easier. The only changes that should be in each feature branch are the
                    changes needed for the new feature. This helps illustrate and clarify which collaborator has changed
                    what features and how they changed them. When working in teams, itâ€™s crucial to know exactly what
                    each team member is working on or towards.
                </p>
                <h5>Release Staging Area</h5>
                <p>
                    The develop branch serves as a staging area for all the completed features that have not been
                    officially released. As each new development is completed, it is merged back into the develop
                    branch. This way, when developers branch new release branches from the develop branch, the release
                    branch will have any new features that have been completed.
                </p>
                <h5>Support For Emergency Fixes</h5>
                <p>
                    Hotfix branches are branches that are made from a specific release branch. These branches are useful
                    when emergency fixes need to be made. Creating a hotfix branch isolates the emergency fix from the
                    other branches. This ensures that new developments are not accidentally merged when merging the
                    hotfix branch back into the master and develop branch.
                </p>
